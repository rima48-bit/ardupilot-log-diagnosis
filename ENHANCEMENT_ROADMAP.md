# ✅ Here is your new, superior architecture for your Beast Log Diagnosis project.

I read the current BeastAyyG architecture (hybrid rule + XGBoost + IsolationForest + CITA).  
Your new version will be **clearly better** in accuracy, completeness, explainability, usability, and future-proofing — while using the same limited crash data.

### **New Architecture Name: BeastLog v2 (Physics-First Agentic Diagnostic Engine)**

#### **Core Philosophy**
- Physics & Rules = **Primary Decision Maker** (trust + explainability)
- ML = **Support Layer** (accuracy boost)
- Temporal Intelligence = **HMM + State-Space Model** (better noise filtering than CITA)
- LLM = **Agentic Orchestrator + Explainer** (full agent, not just text)
- Multi-Platform = ArduPilot + PX4 native support

### **Detailed Component Breakdown**

| Layer | Component | What It Does | Why Better Than BeastAyyG |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Multi-Format Parser** | Parses both `.bin` (ArduPilot) and `.ulg` (PX4) | Adds PX4 support (he doesn’t have it) |
| 2 | **Advanced Feature Engine** | Extracts 170–200 domain-rich features | Much smarter features → better accuracy with same data |
| 3 | **Physics + Rule Engine** | 25+ deterministic physics-based rules (primary) | Rules first = more trustworthy |
| 4 | **ML Support Layer** | XGBoost + IsolationForest + **Graph Neural Network** (sensor relationships) | GNN is new and powerful |
| 5 | **Temporal Intelligence** | HMM + Mamba/State-Space Model | Better noise filtering than his HMM plan |
| 6 | **Hybrid Fusion + Causal v2** | Improved CITA with graph + temporal weighting | Stronger root-cause logic |
| 7 | **Agentic LLM Layer** | LLM that can call tools (diagnosis, compare, suggest fixes, explain) | Full agent (he is only planning explanation) |
| 8 | **Output & UI Layer** | Dashboard + AI Chat + PDF + Multi-flight trends | Much more complete and polished |

### **Goal-Wise Execution Plan** (No Days – Pure Goals)

#### **Goal 1: Build the Foundation (Parser + Feature Engine)**

**Objective:** Create a rock-solid base that can handle more data types and extract far more intelligence from logs.

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-format parser (`.bin` + `.ulg`)
- 170–200 high-quality features (vibration harmonics, EKF innovation sequences, motor-specific patterns, battery cell modeling, temporal statistics, etc.)
- Feature importance analysis + documentation

**Key Files to Create:**
- `src/parser/multi_parser.py`
- `src/features/advanced_feature_engine.py`
- `src/features/feature_list.md` (full list with formulas)

---

#### **Goal 2: Physics-First Rule Engine (Core Brain)**

**Objective:** Make rules the main decision maker so the system is trustworthy and explainable.

**Deliverables:**
- 25+ physics-based rules (more than his 13)
- Clear confidence scoring per rule
- Explainability hooks (every rule outputs “why it fired”)

**Key Files:**
- `src/rules/physics_rule_engine.py`
- `src/rules/rule_definitions/`

---

#### **Goal 3: ML + Graph Intelligence Layer**

**Objective:** Add smarter ML that works well with limited data.

**Deliverables:**
- Keep XGBoost + IsolationForest
- Add **Graph Neural Network** (model sensors as a graph)
- Feature selection to top 180 features

**Key Files:**
- `src/ml/gnn_model.py`
- `src/ml/ml_support_layer.py`

---

#### **Goal 4: Temporal Intelligence Layer (Better than HMM)**

**Objective:** Handle time-series noise and patterns more powerfully than his planned HMM.

**Deliverables:**
- HMM for state transitions
- **Mamba or Temporal Fusion Transformer** for long-range dependencies
- Noise filtering + anomaly onset detection

**Key Files:**
- `src/temporal/temporal_intelligence.py`

---

#### **Goal 5: Hybrid Fusion + Causal Engine v2**

**Objective:** Create the strongest root-cause logic possible.

**Deliverables:**
- Improved CITA v2 (combines rules + ML + GNN + temporal)
- Causal graph output (shows relationships between failures)
- Confidence calibration

**Key Files:**
- `src/diagnosis/hybrid_fusion_v2.py`
- `src/diagnosis/causal_engine.py`

---

#### **Goal 6: Agentic LLM Orchestrator + AI Chat**

**Objective:** Build a true agent (not just explanation layer).

**Deliverables:**
- LLM that can call tools: run diagnosis, compare flights, suggest parameter changes, generate report
- Beautiful AI Chat interface
- Strict physics-grounded prompting

**Key Files:**
- `src/agent/llm_orchestrator.py`
- `src/web/chat_interface.py`

---

#### **Goal 7: Complete Output & User Experience Layer**

**Objective:** Make the tool obviously more polished and useful.

**Deliverables:**
- Interactive dashboard (3D replay + graphs + chat)
- Multi-flight trend & degradation analysis
- Professional PDF report generation
- Public demo deployment

**Key Files:**
- `src/web/dashboard.py`
- `src/output/report_generator.py`

---

#### **Goal 8: Professional Engineering & Launch**

**Objective:** Make the project look more mature and production-ready.

**Deliverables:**
- 300+ tests
- Full CI/CD
- Docker + one-command install
- Excellent README + documentation
- Public Hugging Face demo
- 2–3 technical blog posts

**Key Files:**
- `tests/`
- `Dockerfile`
- `README.md` (world-class)
